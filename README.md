# enterprise-fbm
An example Messenger bot using CondÃ© Nast's [`launch-vehicle-fbm`]. The `enterprise-fbm` name is a nod to the [first orbiter of the Space Shuttle system]. Got to keep the ðŸš€ theme going, right?

The SDK is currently in pre-release, meaning it is not yet published via `npm`. The repo is public, however, which means bot developers can start tinkering now!

A fully baked _how to_ blog post is coming with the official launch of v1.0.

### Using this example

This is not going to cover setting up a Facebook page and application with the necessary identifiers and secrets. I would recommend reading through the [Messenger Platform Quick Start Guide] provided by Facebook.

This also assumes that [nodemon] is installed globally. Feel free to edit the _dev_ scipts in `packages.json` to your liking if nodemon is not a part of your preferred development setup.

Clone the `launch-vehicle-fbm` repo:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:CondeNast/launch-vehicle-fbm.git
```

Change into the directory containing the cloned SDK and create a globally-installed symbolic link:
```shell
cd launch-vehicle-fbm
npm link
```

Clone this repo, `enterprise-fbm` repo into a separate directory:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:stripethree/enterprise-fbm.git
```

Change into the directory containing the cloned
example and link the `launch-vehicle-fbm` module:
```shell
cd enterprise-fbm
npm link launch-vehicle-fbm
```

Copy `example.env` to `.env` and replace it with the identifiers and secrets for your Facebook page and application. Then export these values into the environment:
```shell
export $(cat .env | xargs)
```

Start up [_localtunnel_], I'd recommend using the _subdomain_ argument:
```shell
lt --port 3000 --subdomain <pick a subdomain>
```

Start up the bot!
```shell
npm run dev
```

Off you go! The example supports responding to greetings (try saying _hello_) and requests for assistance (try saying _help_). It will also echo back any other text sent as well as images sent.
